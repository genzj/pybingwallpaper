**NOTE** For Windows users, the setter must be copied into the folder containing ``BingWallpaper.exe``, normally named ``Scripts`` in Python installation path or virtual-env path. E.g. assuming the PyBingWallpaper is installed under virtualenv ``.\venv``, the `winsetter.py`_ must be downloaded to the ``.\venv\Scripts`` folder.
